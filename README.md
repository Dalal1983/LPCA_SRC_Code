# LPCA_SRC_Code
Contains implementation code for classification algorithm LPCA_SRC

MATLAB and Python versions available. Each implementation uses LPCA-SRC function code as well as Normalize and local_PCA. 
MATLAB code has the advantage of offering a choice of l1-minimization algorithms and options for setting intrinsic dimension
estimate d. In Python, d must be determined prior to running function.
