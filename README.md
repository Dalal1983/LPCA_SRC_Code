# LPCA_SRC_Code
Contains implementation code for classification algorithm LPCA_SRC

MATLAB and Python versions available for LPCA-SRC, from the paper "Improving sparse representation-based classification using local principal component analysis" by C. Weaver and N. Saito, arXiv:1607.01059. 

Each implementation uses LPCA-SRC function code as well as Normalize and Local_PCA. 
The MATLAB version of the code has the advantage of offering a choice of l1-minimization algorithms and options for setting intrinsic dimension estimate d. In Python, d must be determined prior to running function.
